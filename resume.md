Experience
----------

**King, Technical Director**
*January 2015 - December 2015 (1 year) | București, România*

Managing 35 programmers and making sure that aspects like communication,
knowledge sharing and personal growth are not overshadowed by the stringent
needs of the projects. Finding the right balance was the hardest thing
to achieve. Other aspects of my job:

* Recruiting - Interviews, defining the candidate profile
* On-boarding - Helping new employees getting productive as fast as possible
* Coaching - Work with my colleagues to help them achieve their goals
* New projects - When focusing on the imediate deadline it is hard to spot
opportunities for improvement or even if these are obvious there's always
a lack of priority. I facilitated these kinds of projects, incubating them with
as few resources as possible and some of them became company wide projects. The
automation testing initiative is an example of this. On most projects I started
the prototypes and then gradually involving people while the project started
getting traction.

**King, Team Lead Software Developer**
*October 2011 - December 2014 (3 years 3 months) | București, România*

Delivering and maintaining games on mobile platforms using custom games engines,
written in C++.

* Writing KRAL - KRAL is a meta build system in the sense that it already uses
	CMake to do the heavy lifting and it adds support for packages, multiple
	targets	in the same repository and other things to facilitate the developing
	and delivery of a game to multiple platforms at the same time. This is a
	project I started (on Bubble Witch Saga) and now is still used for most of the
	projects inside the company. The project is open source and you can find it on
	[https://github.com/phaser/KRAL](GitHub).

* Adobe Flash implementation - I did a basic implementation of Adobe Flash SWF 
	format. The implementation could open swf files directly and render images,
	animations and movie clips (no AS support, although we had some callback
	mechanisms to interact with the C++ code).

* Custom Selenium Client - Writing a custom implementation of JSON Wire Protocol
	to enable automation testing of the games using Selenium.

* Other - Setting up servers (GitLab, Apache, Wiki, Jenkins), gameplay features,
	game engine optimizations (rendering, memory consumption, performance).  

**Electronic Arts, Software Engineer**
*October 2008 - October 2011, (3 years 1 month) | București, România*

Working on games for feature phones and later smart phones after the launch of
the iPhone by Apple.

* Star Trek - Java, J2ME | Programmer
* Medal of Honor - Java, J2ME | C++, BREW | Lead Programmer
* FIFA Superstars - C++, iPhone, Android | Programmer
* Engine - Optimized VM for in-game scripting

**Wind River Systems, Software Engineer**
*January 2007 - September 2008 (1 year 9 months) | Galați, România*

Worked as part of the services division of Wind River Systems.

* In seat infotainment system - An application that was running on the screens
	embedded in the seats of airplanes that would deliver movies, music,
	games and various informations to the passengers. Project was mostly
	written in C on Linux using GTK+.
* Contacts section - Implementing the presence and contact management for a
	custom conferencing system.
* BSP - Creating new package implementations for Wind River Linux and fixing
	existing ones to work on new boards and/or platforms.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
