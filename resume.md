Experience
----------

**[Amber](https://amberstudio.com), Technical Leader**
*July 2017 - Present | București, România*

Worked on two games that were prototypes for testing new casual games for mobile phones (iOS, Android). 
At the same time I've architected a platform for casual games for [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com) that 
supported all kinds of casual games (match 3, poppers, linkers, physics based). The platform allows teams
to prototype these types of games in a shorter time, enabling them to have a working prototype in a week
being bound by how fast new graphics and gfx can be added to the game.

**[Qualitance](https://www.qualitance.com), Software Engineer**
*September 2016 - June 2017 (10 months) | București, România*

Implemented virtual reality application for fashion retailers using [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/)
on [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift). The application was a multiplayer experience in which
up to 4 friends could watch together a fashion show and vote on their favorite outfits, having the
option to actually try those outfits in stores afterward.

As part of the same project I've worked on a touch screen table application and a Kinect mirror that
lets users try on outfits.

**[King](https://king.com), Technical Director**
*January 2015 - December 2015 (1 year) | București, România*

Managing 35 programmers and making sure that aspects like communication,
knowledge sharing and personal growth are not overshadowed by the stringent
needs of the projects. Finding the right balance was the hardest thing
to achieve. Other aspects of my job:

* Recruiting - Interviews, defining the candidate profile
* On-boarding - Helping new employees getting productive as fast as possible
* Coaching - Work with my colleagues to help them achieve their goals
* New projects - When focusing on the imediate deadline it is hard to spot
	opportunities for improvement or even if these are obvious there's always
	a lack of priority. I facilitated these kinds of projects, incubating them with
	as few resources as possible and some of them became company wide projects. The
	automation testing initiative is an example of this. On most projects I started
	the prototypes and then gradually involving people while the project started
	getting traction.

**[King](https://king.com), Team Lead Software Developer**
*October 2011 - December 2014 (3 years 3 months) | București, România*

Delivering and maintaining games on mobile platforms using custom games engines,
written in C++.

* Writing KRAL - KRAL is a meta build system in the sense that it already uses
	CMake to do the heavy lifting and it adds support for packages, multiple
	targets	in the same repository and other things to facilitate the developing
	and delivery of a game to multiple platforms at the same time. This is a
	project I started (on Bubble Witch Saga) and now is still used for most of the
	projects inside the company. The project is open source and you can find it on
	[https://github.com/phaser/KRAL](GitHub).

* Adobe Flash implementation - I did a basic implementation of Adobe Flash SWF 
	format. The implementation could open swf files directly and render images,
	animations and movie clips (no AS support, although we had some callback
	mechanisms to interact with the C++ code).

* Custom Selenium Client - Writing a custom implementation of JSON Wire Protocol
	to enable automation testing of the games using Selenium.

* Other - Setting up servers (GitLab, Apache, Wiki, Jenkins), gameplay features,
	game engine optimizations (rendering, memory consumption, performance).  

**[Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com), Software Engineer**
*October 2008 - October 2011, (3 years 1 month) | București, România*

Working on games for feature phones and later smart phones after the launch of
the iPhone by Apple.

* Star Trek - Java, J2ME | Programmer
* Medal of Honor - Java, J2ME | C++, BREW | Lead Programmer
* FIFA Superstars - C++, iPhone, Android | Programmer
* Engine - Optimized VM for in-game scripting

**[Wind River Systems](http://www.windriver.com), Software Engineer**
*January 2007 - September 2008 (1 year 9 months) | Galați, România*

Worked as part of the services division of Wind River Systems.

* In seat infotainment system - An application that was running on the screens
	embedded in the seats of airplanes that would deliver movies, music,
	games and various informations to the passengers. Project was mostly
	written in C on Linux using GTK+.
* Contacts section - Implementing the presence and contact management for a
	custom conferencing system.
* BSP - Creating new package implementations for Wind River Linux and fixing
	existing ones to work on new boards and/or platforms.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Programming Languages
:   **C++:** As the experience section shows I've used C++ in most of the
	projects I've worked on.

:   **Java:** I've developed in Java for a number of years working on
	resource constrained applications (EA, J2ME games) but also backend
	enterprise applications, where the emphasis was on architecture
	and scalability.

:   **C** Besides Pascal which was my first language, C is my other language
	in which I learned programming. I've also used C professionally mostly
	while working for Wind River. Afterwards I wrote C as part of C++
	applications.

:   **R** I like data and getting insights out of it. So I started a specialization
	on Coursera in which I learned R and Statistics.

:   Fair knowledge of **C#**, **PHP**, **Delphi**

:   Basic knowledge of **x86 assembly**, **Python**, **Objective-C**, **Java Script**


Projects  
:   **Raytracer:** I love graphics and so I started implementing a path tracer
	but until now I have the basic raytracing code that can render texture
	mapped meshes and basic 3d objects (planes, spheres) with shadows and 
	several types of lights and materials. I hope I'll get the time to
	transition this to a propper path tracer. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/phaser/raytracer)

:   **Quintessence:** This is my C++ game engine. It's basic: it only 
	renders 2d sprites. But the low-level parts are there, including the
	support for multiple mobile platforms. Also there is the basis for a
	game editor with QT that can open the game as an external lib inside the
	QT window. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/phaser/quintessence)
